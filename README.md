# Portfolio App with MongoDB Integration

I've built a portfolio application that's connected with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a versatile document-based database ideal for the modern cloud era. This repository houses various projects that I've developed, showcasing my ability to work with databases, APIs, and modern UI libraries.

## Technologies Used:

- **NextUI**: For a modern, responsive user interface.
- **NextJS**: A React framework for server-rendered applications.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **MongoDB**: For database management and operations.

## Projects Overview:

### 1. Poems App

- Contains a collection of my favorite poems.
- Provides the ability to tag each poem.
- Features an option to fetch a random poem from the database.

### 2. Recipes App

- A daily-used web app to explore favorite recipes.
- User-friendly interface showing steps and ingredients simultaneously.
- Includes a filter to sort recipes based on available cooking time.

### 3. Disperse App

- Originally forked from an Ethereum-based app, now modified for the Moonsama network.
- Designed for community campaigns, allowing for token dispersion to up to 200 addresses in a single transaction.
- A great tool that's already saved over 40 hours of manual work.

### 4. Consultancy Therapy WordPress Site

- A freelance project built with Elementor.
- Features a functional webshop.
- Contains contact forms and program sign-ups.
- **Note**: Currently using a third-party extension for Facebook feed scraping due to the discontinuation of support from Elementor.
