# Portfolio App with MongoDB Integration

I've built a portfolio application that's connected with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a versatile document-based database ideal for the modern cloud era. This repository houses various projects that I've developed, showcasing my ability to work with databases, APIs, and modern UI libraries.

## Technologies Used:

- **NextUI**: For a modern, responsive user interface.
- **NextJS**: A React framework for server-rendered applications.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **MongoDB**: For database management and operations.

## Projects Overview:

### 1. Poems App

- Contains a collection of my favorite poems.
- Provides the ability to tag each poem.
- Features an option to fetch a random poem from the database.

### 2. Recipes App

- A daily-used web app to explore favorite recipes.
- User-friendly interface showing steps and ingredients simultaneously.
- Includes a filter to sort recipes based on available cooking time.

### 3. Disperse App

- Originally forked from an Ethereum-based app, now modified for the Moonsama network.
- Designed for community campaigns, allowing for token dispersion to up to 200 addresses in a single transaction.
- A great tool that's already saved over 40 hours of manual work.

### 4. Consultancy Therapy WordPress Site

- A freelance project built with Elementor.
- Features a functional webshop.
- Contains contact forms and program sign-ups.
- **Note**: Currently using a third-party extension for Facebook feed scraping due to the discontinuation of support from Elementor.

## Key Learnings:

1. Effective communication with MongoDB through APIs.
2. Database Operations: Mastered the CRUD operations using MongoDB, gaining a deep understanding of how to interact with a NoSQL database programmatically.
3. Full-Stack Development: Developed proficiency in full-stack development by connecting the frontend built with NextJS and TailwindCSS to the MongoDB database through APIs.
4. User Experience Design: Enhanced my skills in creating user-centric designs, particularly evident in the Recipes App, where the user can view both steps and ingredients simultaneously for a seamless cooking experience.
5. Smart Contract Interaction: Gained practical experience in blockchain development and smart contract interactions while modifying the Disperse App to work on the Moonsama network.
6. Performance Optimization: Learned how to optimize the performance of web applications, ensuring faster load times and smoother interactions, even when dealing with large amounts of data.
7. Problem-Solving: Developed strong problem-solving skills, especially in debugging and finding workarounds for issues like the Facebook feed scraping in the WordPress site.
8. API Integration: Enhanced my skills in integrating and working with various APIs, ensuring smooth data flow between the frontend, backend, and external services.
9. Responsive Design: Gained expertise in creating responsive designs using TailwindCSS, ensuring that all the applications in the portfolio provide an excellent user experience across various devices.
10. Security Practices: Learned about best practices for securing web applications and user data, particularly when interacting with databases and executing transactions on the blockchain.
11. Version Control: Improved my skills in using version control systems like Git, which is essential for maintaining code integrity and collaboration.
12. Continuous Learning: The diverse range of projects in the portfolio fostered a culture of continuous learning, as each project required different skills and technologies.
13. Time Management: Developed effective time management skills, learning how to prioritize tasks and manage workloads efficiently across multiple projects.
14. Communication Skills: Enhanced my ability to communicate complex technical details effectively, both within the code through comments, and externally through documentation and collaborative tools.
