## Portfolio app using MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era. 


## Help me fix issues

I listed several painpoints under issues help and explanation is always appreciated.

## What to expect

I connected the portfolio into MongoDB and can do basic operation like read/upload/edit from and to the database with API calls. 
I'm using NextUI, NextJS and TailwindCCS to build the UI you see.

- Poems app
    Contains randomly selected favorite poems. With the ability to tag each and get a random poem from the database.

- Recipes app
    I use this webapp almost everyday to check for our favorite recipes with my girlfriend. I built it with having user experience in mind. You can see the steps and ingredients at all times on the same screen. And filter recipes based on how much time you have.

- Disperse app
    It's a project I built for my community when I ran Zealy campaigns marketing campaigns I often founds myself in tricky situations where I couldn't send tokens to all participants all at once. Forking the disperse app that was already built on Etherum and modified it to work on Moonsama network. Can use it to send tokens up to 200 addresses with a single transaction. Saved me at least 40+ hrs of manual work already.

-Consultancy therapy Wordpress site with webshop
    Freelance assigment of a Wordpress site using Elementor and a simple webshop. All contact forms and program sign up working. Webshop also working only bug left to solve is Elementor stopped supporting Facebook feed a while ago. So I'm using a different extension to scrape Facebook feed for current events. (needs to be manully scraped once in a while)
